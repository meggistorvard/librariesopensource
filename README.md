# Powerfull libraries Open-source for your website

## Open Source for More Flexibility

Library website is considered as communication tool, which help to create and publish the information regarding its activities and services. 

Bigger libraries with staff or consultants dedicated to their sites' design and maintenance will need a CMS that allows for more architectural complexity and design flexibility. A few experts we interviewed mentioned the library sector's commitment to open-source CMS platforms to meet these needs, in line with its general support for the freedom of information. Open-source software source code is available to anyone who wants to customize it. The software is often overseen by a community of developers or a nonprofit rather than a for-profit company. It's free to download and use, but installing and implementing it ó and finding support for problems ó may require working with a consultant with technical skills and familiarity with the system. Ready for use.

# TinyMCE script by 

TinyMCE 5 is a powerful and flexible rich text editor that can be embedded in web applications. This quick start covers how to add a TinyMCE editor to a web page using the Tiny Cloud.

<img src="https://meggistorvard.github.io/images/tinymce_editor.png" title="tinymce editor" alt="tinymce editor">

## Quick start 

Get an instance of TinyMCE 3 verion up and running using the Tiny Cloud.

### Step 1: Include the TinyMCE script

Include the following line of code in the <head> of a HTML page.

```
<script src="https://cdn.tiny.cloud/1/no-api-key/tinymce/5/tinymce.min.js" referrerpolicy="origin"></script>
or
<script src="https://cdn.tiny.cloud/1/no-api-key/tinymce/5/tinymce.min.js" referrerpolicy="origin"></script>
```

### Step 2: Initialize TinyMCE as part of a web form

Initialize TinyMCE 5 on any element (or elements) on the web page by passing an object containing a selector value to tinymce.init(). The selector value can be any valid CSS selector.

For example

```
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" dir="ltr">
<head>
  <title>TinyMCE Test</title>
  <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"/>

  <!-- OF COURSE YOU NEED TO ADAPT NEXT LINE TO YOUR tiny_mce.js PATH -->
  <script type="text/javascript" src="../jscripts/tiny_mce/tiny_mce.js"></script>

  <script type="text/javascript">
    tinyMCE.init({
      mode : "textareas"
    });
    </script>
</head>
<body>

  <!-- OF COURSE YOU NEED TO ADAPT ACTION TO WHAT PAGE YOU WANT TO LOAD WHEN HITTING "SAVE" -->
  <form method="post" action="show.php">
    <p>
      <textarea name="content" cols="50" rows="15">This is some content that will be editable with TinyMCE.</textarea>
      <input type="submit" value="Save" />
    </p>
</form>

</body>
</html>
```

Same example using some more buttons

```
<script type="text/javascript">
  tinyMCE.init({
    mode : "textareas"
  });
</script>
```

Adding this content to a HTML file and opening it in a web browser will load a TinyMCE editor, such as:

## Step 3: Add your API key

Replace no-api-key in the source script (<script src=...) with a Tiny Cloud API key, which is created when signing up to the Tiny Cloud.

### Step 4: Save the content with a form POST

Process the content with a form handler.


### Next Steps

TinyMCE inline editing mode.
