# Powerfull libraries Open-source for your website

## Open Source for More Flexibility

Library website is considered as communication tool, which help to create and publish the information regarding its activities and services. 

Bigger libraries with staff or consultants dedicated to their sites' design and maintenance will need a CMS that allows for more architectural complexity and design flexibility. A few experts we interviewed mentioned the library sector's commitment to open-source CMS platforms to meet these needs, in line with its general support for the freedom of information. Open-source software source code is available to anyone who wants to customize it. The software is often overseen by a community of developers or a nonprofit rather than a for-profit company. It's free to download and use, but installing and implementing it — and finding support for problems — may require working with a consultant with technical skills and familiarity with the system.
